Funding Opportunity Description</div>\n<p>The overall goal of the\n  NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) program is to\n  help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in\n  appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical,\n  behavioral, and clinical research needs.  In order to accomplish this goal, NRSA training programs\n  are designed to train individuals to conduct research and to prepare for\n  research careers. More information\n  about NRSA programs may be found at the <a\nhref=\"//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=41125\">Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service\n  Award (NRSA)</a> website.<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<div class=\"heading4\">Purpose and Background Information</div>\n<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes the need\n  to diversify the scientific workforce by enhancing the participation of individuals\n  from groups identified as <a\nhref=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-210.html\">underrepresented</a> in\n  the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences (collectively termed\n  \"biomedical\") research workforce. Research shows that diverse teams\n  working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives\n  outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds\n  and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual\n  interests to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that\n  flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including fostering\n  scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust\n  learning environments, improving the quality of research, enhancing public\n  trust, and increasing the likelihood that health disparities and the needs of\n  underserved populations are addressed in biomedical research. </p>\n<p>NIGMS strives to ensure that future generations of researchers\n  will be drawn from the entire pool of talented individuals, bringing different\n  aptitudes, perspectives, interests, and experiences to address complex\n  scientific problems. NIGMS seeks to enhance the diversity of the biomedical\n  research workforce by supporting individuals from a variety of backgrounds at\n  multiple training and career stages in a variety of institutions and\n  educational settings across the country. Accordingly, NIGMS developed separate\n  institutional eligibility tracks for review and funding of its undergraduate\n  and graduate diversity enhancing programs based on NIH <a\nhref=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#ResearchProjectGrantRPG\">research\n  project grant (RPG)</a> funding levels. The two tracks include\n  research-intensive, i.e., those with an average of NIH RPG funding greater than\n  or equal to $7.5 million total costs over the past 3 fiscal years, and\n  research-active, i.e., those with an average of RPG funding less than $7.5\n  million total costs over the past 3 fiscal years (RPG data are available\n  through <a href=\"https://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm\">NIH RePORTER</a>). To\n  prevent the duplication of diversity enhancing NIGMS programs, each institution\n  will be eligible for one diversity enhancing undergraduate program (either\n  Maximizing Access to Research Careers, <a\nhref=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-18-031.html\">MARC</a>,\n  or Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement, <a\nhref=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-18-030.html\">U-RISE</a>)\n  regardless of the activity code (R25 or T34), and one diversity enhancing\n  graduate program (either the Initiative to Maximize Student Development, <a\nhref=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-18-028.html\">IMSD</a>,\n  or <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-18-029.html\">G-RISE</a>)\n  regardless of the activity code (R25 or T32). Institutions with MARC, U-RISE,\n  IMSD or G-RISE are eligible to participate in the Bridges to the Baccalaureate\n  and/or Bridges to the Doctorate programs. </p>\n<p><strong>Need\n  for the Program</strong></p>\n<p>In spite of recent advances, individuals from certain groups\n  and backgrounds are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences research\n  workforce as described in <a\nhref=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-210.html\">NIH's\n  Interest in Diversity</a>.  The severity of the underrepresentation of these\n  groups increases throughout the training stages. For example, students from\n  certain racial and ethnic groups, including Blacks or African Americans,\n  Hispanics or Latinos, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and\n  other Pacific Islanders comprise ~39 percent of the college age population (<a\nhref=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml\">Census\n  Bureau</a> data), but earn only ~17 percent of bachelor’s degrees and ~13\n  percent of Ph.D. degrees in the life sciences (<a\nhref=\"https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/data-tools.cfm\">National Center for\n  Science and Engineering Statistics</a>). Additionally, while the United States\n  has seen a significant increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees in the\n  biomedical sciences earned by scientists from groups underrepresented in the\n  biomedical research workforce, a corresponding increase in the ranks of the\n  faculty in basic science departments at medical schools has not occurred\n  (Gibbs, et al., 2016, eLife 2016, 5:e21393; Valantine, Lund & Gammie,\n  CBE-Life Sciences Education, 2016, 15:fe4).</p>\n<p>Several reports (see for example, <a\nhref=\"https://acd.od.nih.gov/documents/reports/DiversityBiomedicalResearchWorkforceReport.pdf\">ACD\n  Working Group on Diversity in the Biomedical Workforce, 2012</a>; <a\nhref=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_2-25-12.pdf\">PCAST\n  Report, 2012</a>; <a\nhref=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/booklets/college-careers\"\ntitle=\"Link to Non-U.S. Government Site\">From College to Careers: Fostering\n  Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in STEM, 2014</a>; and <a\nhref=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/white_house_report_on_increasing_college_opportunity_for_low-income_students.pdf\">Increasing\n  College Opportunity for Low Income Students, 2014</a>) recommend supporting\n  programs that strive to recruit, train, and mentor students from\n  underrepresented groups who have an interest in science, technology,\n  engineering and math (STEM) as a means to effectively build a diverse and\n  competitive scientific workforce.</p>\n<div class=\"heading4\">Programmatic Approach</div>\n<p>This FOA is intended to enable the community to develop and\n  implement evidence-based approaches to biomedical research training and\n  mentoring to enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce. The\n  President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report\n  provided evidence that financial concerns and a deficit of peers from similar\n  backgrounds can erode self-confidence and the will to remain in STEM majors (<a\nhref=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_2-25-12.pdf\">PCAST\n  Report, 2012</a>). NIGMS diversity enhancing institutional training grants\n  offset the cost of appointed trainee stipends, tuition and fees, and training\n  related expenses, including health insurance, in accordance with the approved\n  NIH support levels.  Additionally, funded programs are expected to provide\n  activities that will build a strong cohort of research-oriented individuals\n  while enhancing the science identity, self-efficacy, and a sense of belonging\n  among the cohort members. Programmatic activities include, but are not limited\n  to, providing authentic research experiences, academic enhancements, skills\n  development, and additional mentoring - activities proven to increase\n  persistence in STEM fields (cited in <a\nhref=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_feb.pdf\">PCAST\n  Report, 2012</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25038/graduate-stem-education-for-the-21st-century\">Graduate\n  STEM Education for the 21st Century, 2018</a>). Each program should provide\n  high-quality training that equips individuals with the technical (e.g.,\n  appropriate methods, technologies, and quantitative/computational approaches),\n  operational (e.g., independent knowledge acquisition, rigorous experimental\n  design, and interpretation of data) and professional (e.g., management,\n  leadership, communication, and teamwork) skills required for careers in the\n  biomedical research workforce. Funded programs are expected to promote\n  inclusive research environments (i.e., institutional and departmental\n  environments where trainees from all backgrounds feel integrated into and\n  supported by the biomedical research community).</p>\n<div class=\"heading4\">Program Objective</div>\n<p>The <strong>Overarching\n  Objective</strong> of this Graduate Research Training Initiative for Student\n  Enhancement program is to develop a diverse pool of well-trained Ph.D.\n  biomedical scientists, who have the following technical, operational, and\n  professional skills:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> A broad understanding across biomedical disciplines and the\n    skills to independently acquire the knowledge needed to advance their chosen\n    fields;</li>\n  <li> The ability to think critically and independently, and to\n    identify important biomedical research questions and approaches that push\n    forward the boundaries of their areas of study; </li>\n  <li> A strong foundation in scientific reasoning, rigorous research\n    design, experimental methods, quantitative and computational approaches, and\n    data analysis and interpretation;</li>\n  <li> A commitment to approaching and conducting biomedical research\n    responsibly, ethically, and with integrity; </li>\n  <li> Experience initiating, conducting, interpreting, and presenting\n    rigorous and reproducible biomedical research with increasing self-direction;</li>\n  <li> The ability to work effectively in teams with colleagues from a\n    variety of cultural and scientific backgrounds, and to promote inclusive and\n    supportive scientific research environments;</li>\n  <li> The skills to teach and communicate scientific research\n    methodologies and findings to a wide variety of audiences (e.g.,\n    discipline-specific, across disciplines, and the public); and</li>\n  <li> The knowledge, professional skills and experiences required to\n    identify and transition into careers in the biomedical research workforce\n    (i.e., the breadth of careers that sustain biomedical research in areas that\n    are relevant to the NIH mission).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Diversity at all levels—from the\n  kinds of science to the regions in which it is conducted to the backgrounds of\n  the people conducting it— contributes to excellence in research training\n  environments and strengthens the research enterprise. This FOA is intended to\n  support outstanding research training programs that will enhance diversity at\n  all levels. As part of a larger initiative to enhance diversity, the <a\nname=\"_Hlk519145570\">G-RISE </a>program will support trainees earning a Ph.D.\n  at research-active institutions.</p>\n<div class=\"heading4\"><a name=Considerations>Program Considerations</a></div>\n<p>NIGMS intends to fund applications that propose feasible\n  academic and research focused training programs that will enhance diversity in\n  the biomedical workforce. Applicants are expected to identify training\n  objectives (i.e., specific, measurable, and obtainable outcomes the program\n  intends to achieve) and to develop plans to implement evidence-based training\n  and mentoring activities that are grounded in the literature and from\n  evaluations of existing relevant programs. Program objectives must align with\n  the overarching goal of the G-RISE diversity enhancing program. Funded programs\n  are expected to provide evidence of accomplishing the training objectives in\n  progress reports and upon renewal, to make training and career outcomes\n  publicly available, and are strongly encouraged to disseminate successful\n  training practices to the broader community.</p>\n<p>Institutional commitment and support for the proposed\n  training program are important elements of the application. The G-RISE program\n  may complement and synergize with other ongoing federally-supported predoctoral\n  research training programs at the applicant institution (e.g., in the\n  development of skills needed for careers in the biomedical research workforce);\n  however, the G-RISE program goals and activities to achieve those goals must be\n  distinct from related programs currently receiving federal support at the same\n  institution.  In cases where an institution has multiple NIGMS training grants,\n  it is expected that these programs will seek to create administrative\n  efficiencies to reduce costs and improve trainee services and outcomes. The\n  training grant should be well integrated within one or more\n  department(s)/program(s) and should exert a strong, positive influence on the\n  development and execution of the curriculum, training opportunities, and\n  mentoring. Training grant funds may not be used solely as a vehicle to provide\n  stipends for trainees to conduct research.</p>\n<p>NIGMS does not accept applications for predoctoral T32\n  programs proposing only short-term research training (T35). Programs proposing\n  short-term research training should apply to the Kirschstein-NRSA Short-Term\n  Institutional Research Training Grant Program (T35) exclusively reserved for\n  predoctoral, short-term research training (see <a\nhref=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-18-404.html\">PA-18-404</a> and subsequent reissuances but note that NIGMS does not participate in that\n  FOA).  NIGMS will not accept applications proposing combined predoctoral\n  and postdoctoral training under this FOA. </p>\n<p>Training grants are usually awarded for five years. Students\n  are typically provided full-time support for two to three years of graduate\n  studies. Use of training grant support in the first three years of graduate\n  research training is strongly encouraged to provide maximum flexibility in the\n  participation in courses, laboratory rotations, professional development, and\n  cohort-building activities. </p>\n<p>This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) does not allow\n  appointed Trainees to lead an independent clinical trial but does allow them to\n  obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.\n  NIH strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research\n  and so gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or\n  co-mentor is encouraged.</p>\n<p>See <span class=P_SingleIndent><a href=\"#_Section_VIII._Other\">Section VIII.

        "description": "This training provides information regarding the sponsor and investigator requirements for an IND or IDE as well as resources to ensure compliance with FDA regulations.  There are two separate training modules that each focus on the requirements for the specific regulatory application that the sponsor or sponsor-investigator holds. Sponsors who hold an IND (for drugs and biologics) can complete the training module entitled “IND Sponsor and Investigator Responsibilities.\" Sponsors who hold an IDE (for medical devices) can complete the training module entitled “IDE Sponsor and Investigator Responsibilities.” Duke University's Office of Regulatory Affairs and Quality created versions of the training modules that are available to academic institutions outside of Duke at no cost. They are available in a format that is compatible with most Learning Management Systems (LMS) to give you the ability to track registration and completion of training. They are also available in an HTML format for web viewing and as PDFs. Please visit our website to learn more and to request the modules.",

      "abstract": "Part 1Development and calibration of suitably accurate functional assays for BRCA1 RING domain and BRCT domain missense substitutions could dramatically accelerate clinical classification of rare missense substitutions observed in that gene. Leveraging data from 68,000 full sequence tests of BRCA1 and BRCA2, plus data from the limited number of already classified BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions, we used logistic regression and related techniques to evaluate three BRCA1 RING domain assays. These were recently described high throughput yeast 2-hybrid and E3 ubiquitin ligase assays, plus a newly developed mammalian 2-hybrid assay. While there were concerns about the accuracy of the yeast 2-hybrid assay and the indirect nature of the ubiquitin ligase assay, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay had excellent correlation with existing missense substitution classifications. After calibration, this assay contributed to classification of one newly reported BRCA1 missense substitution. In principal, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay could be converted to a high-throughput format that would likely retain suitable accuracy.\n\nPart 2How does one achieve clinically applicable classification of the vast majority of all possible sequence variants in disease susceptibility genes? BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino-terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a Mammalian 2-hybrid (M2H) assay. Downstream of the M2H laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that about 20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of about 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 47 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity; these are particularly likely to be classified as Likely Pathogenic once human observational data become available.",
